# string-recognizer
A toy finite state machine

I studied theoretical linguistics and lately Ive been getting into web app development.  In an introductory course I took called [Language and Mind: The Chomskyan Program] (http://www.amazon.ca/I-Language-Introduction-Linguistics-Cognitive-Science/dp/0199660174) I learned about Finite State Automaton and wondered how they could help me in web app development. This is just an experiment where Im attempting to implement a formal FSM/FSA that can recognize any string .
